# Kickstarter Campaigns Analysis
Challenge 1 - Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

For selecting a suitable launch date for Louise's play Fever to ensure the succeed, "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" and "Outcomes Based on Goals" were visualized as charts according to the dataset from Kickstarter by analyzing the realationaship between launched date, funding goal and outcomes. Based on the analysis, Louise will be able to determine if the fundraising goal is reasonable for the play Fever and the best month to launch the play.

## Analysis and Challenges

### The Overview of Analysis

* The analysis mainly used PivotTable/PivotChart, countif function, and line chart.  Main data used was "Goal", "Outcomes", and "Date Created Conversion".

### The Overview of Analysis - Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

* The purpose of **"Theater Outcomes by Launch Date"** analysis is to present the counts of successful, failed and canceled resords for theater by monthly based statistics of launched dates. Louise could intuitively view the trends of outcomes according the month launched with line chart.

### Challenges

1. When I working on Deliverable 3, I found the relative links are too long when create relative links for pictures, and it would he an error once the files relocate on computer.  To solve this problem, I uploaded the PNG files to the cloud firstly, then use the source uploaded to disaplay in the README.md file.

2. I got the wrong result of the chart at the beginning when I did Deliverable 2 at the beginning.  Then I go back to the requirments step by step more carefully and found that I forgot to set criteria for subcategory. I went back to reset the fomular and finally got the right result.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
  * The numbers of successful outcomes is the highest over the year.
  * There is a low posibility to fail in November.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  * 
  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  *
  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  *
